# Guess The Number 
## Description
The Number Guessing Game is a simple game built using Python where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range. The game provides feedback on each guess, helping the player narrow down the correct answer.

## Getting Started 
To play the Number Guessing Game, follow the instructions below:

- Run the code using a Python interpreter.
- The game will display a welcome message and inform you that it is thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
- Choose a difficulty level by typing "easy" or "hard" when prompted.
In the easy mode, you have 10 attempts to guess the number.
In the hard mode, you have 5 attempts to guess the number.
- For each attempt, the game will display the number of remaining attempts and prompt you to make a guess.
- Enter a number as your guess.
- The game will provide feedback on whether your guess is too high or too low.
- If you run out of attempts without guessing the correct number, you lose the game.
- If you correctly guess the number, the game will declare you the winner.
