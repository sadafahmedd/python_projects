# High Low Game
## Description
The Higher Lower Game is a fun and interactive game built using Python. In this game, you compare the number of followers of two different Instagram accounts and guess which one has a higher or lower count. The game continues until you make an incorrect guess or choose to stop playing.

## Getting Started
To play the Higher Lower Game, follow the instructions below:

1. Run the code using a Python interpreter.
2. You will be presented with two Instagram account profiles to compare.
3. Each profile will display the account name, description, and country.
4. Choose which account you think has more followers: "A" or "B".
5. Type "A" or "B" as your answer and press Enter.
6. If your guess is correct, your score will increase by 1, and the game will continue with the next profiles.
7. If your guess is incorrect, your final score will be displayed, and the game will end.
8. You can choose to play the game again by running the code again.
