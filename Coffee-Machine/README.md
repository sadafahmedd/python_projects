# Coffee Machine 
## Description
The Coffee Machine Project is a simulation of a coffee vending machine built using Python. It allows users to select their desired coffee drink, input coins for payment, and receive their drink if there are enough resources available. The project also provides a reporting feature to check the current resource levels and profit.

## Getting Started
To use the Coffee Machine, follow the instructions below:

- Run the code using a Python interpreter.
- The program will display the available coffee options: espresso, latte, and cappuccino.
- Enter the name of the coffee drink you want, or type "off" to turn off the machine.
- If you enter "report", the program will display a report showing the current resource levels and profit.
- For each coffee selection, the program will check if there are sufficient resources to make the drink.
- If there are enough resources, the program will prompt you to enter coins.
- Enter the number of quarters, nickels, dimes, and pennies you want to insert.
- The program will calculate the total value of the coins and check if it is enough to cover the cost of the drink.
- If the payment is sufficient, the program will dispense the drink and provide change (if any).
- The program will update the resource levels and profit accordingly.
- If there are insufficient resources or not enough payment, the program will display an appropriate message and exit.
