# Blackjack Card Game
## Description
The Blackjack Game is a text-based game built using Python. In this game, the player attempts to get a hand of cards with a total value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. The player competes against the computer, and the one with a hand closest to 21 wins.

## Getting Started
To play the Blackjack Game, follow the instructions below:

- Run the code using a Python interpreter.
- The program will display the Blackjack logo.
- The player and the computer will be dealt two cards each.
- The player's cards and the value of their hand will be shown.
- The computer's first card will be revealed.
- The player will be prompted to choose whether to draw another card or not.
- If the player chooses to draw another card, a new card will be added to their hand, and the value of their hand will be updated.
- If the player chooses not to draw another card or if their hand value exceeds 21, the game will end.
- The computer will then draw cards until their hand value is at least 17.
- The final hands and scores of both the player and the computer will be shown.
- The winner of the game will be determined based on the scores.
- The player will be prompted to restart the game or exit.
