# Hangman
## Description
The Hangman Game is a classic word guessing game built using Python. In this game, players attempt to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. For each incorrect guess, a part of a hanging man is drawn. The game ends either when the player correctly guesses the word or when the entire hangman is drawn.
