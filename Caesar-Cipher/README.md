# Caesar Cipher Encryption / Decryption
## Description
The Caesar Cipher Project is a Python program that allows you to encrypt or decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher technique. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher that shifts the letters of the alphabet by a certain number of positions.

## How It Works
To use the Caesar Cipher program, follow the instructions below:

- Run the code using a Python interpreter.
- The program will display the Caesar Cipher logo.
- Choose whether you want to encode or decode a message by typing "encode" or "decode" when prompted.
- Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
- Specify the shift number, which determines how many positions the letters should be shifted.
- The program will encrypt or decrypt the message based on your inputs and display the result.
- You will be prompted to continue or exit the program.
- If you choose to continue, you can encrypt or decrypt another message. If you choose to exit, the program will end.
