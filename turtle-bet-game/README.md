# Turtle Bet Game
## Description
The Turtle Race Game is a simple betting game built using Python and the Turtle module. It allows players to place bets on different-colored turtles and watch them race towards the finish line. The game randomly determines the winner, and if the player's bet matches the winning turtle, they win the game.

## How To Play

1. Run the code using a Python interpreter.
2. A game window will open, displaying a text input prompt.
3. Enter the color of the turtle you want to bet on (e.g., "green", "red", "orange", etc.).
4. Press Enter to start the race.
5. Turtles of different colors will begin moving towards the finish line.
6. The race ends when one of the turtles reaches the right side of the screen.
7. The program will display a message indicating whether you won or lost the bet.
8. The game window will remain open until you click anywhere on the screen to close it.
